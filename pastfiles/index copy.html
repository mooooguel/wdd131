                <p>Hello, my name is Michael Watson. I am from Arizona but recently moved to Provo for work and college. I play a lot of sports, mainly basketball and football. I also love to go to the gym often. I am a big fan of video games and hanging out with my friends. I ahve lived in a lot of places. Arizona, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Maryland, Utah, South Korea, and Texas. I speak English as well as Spanish. I have 4 siblings and my parents live in Arizona. Right now I am studying computer science and hope to one day make video games for a living. I also have a YouTube channel you should all check out. I love computers and can't wait to learn more!</p>
