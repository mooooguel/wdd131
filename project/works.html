                <p class="project-desc">Harmony is a project that my brother and I have been working on. It involves a
                    player-made character that is fighting in a war when they are met with new creatures. They go about
                    learning how to work and fight with these creatures and eventually merge. Below is a rudimentary
                    sprite of the player in early stages of the game.</p>

                <p class="project-desc">This game goes through a first person story based adventure that shows insight
                    into the life of a highschool boy named Tom. The setting is in a school and Tom's home neighborhood
                    as he has to solve mysteries and deal with personal relationships.</p>
                <li data-id="3">The Girl That Loves Chipotle <button class="favorite-btn">Add to Favorites</button></li>
                <p class="project-desc">This game is more of an experience that showcases the love story between the
                    character and 'the girl that loves Chipotle'. The goal is to emphasize the impact games can have and
                    the art that can be seen on a screen with lines of code.</p>
