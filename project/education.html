            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p class="desc">I am currently a second-year student at Brigham Young University-Idaho (BYUI), where I am
                pursuing a degree in computer science. My educational journey has been driven by a passion for
                technology, creativity, and problem-solving. Since starting my studies, I have developed a strong
                foundation in programming, algorithms, and software development, all of which are essential for
                realizing my long-term goal of creating video games.

                My desire to make video games stems from my love of storytelling and interactive experiences. Growing
                up, video games were more than just entertainment; they were a medium that inspired creativity, critical
                thinking, and collaboration. I aspire to contribute to this industry by designing games that are both
                engaging and meaningful, blending art and technology to deliver unique player experiences.

                In my computer science coursework, I have been exploring concepts such as object-oriented programming,
                data structures, and software engineering, all of which play critical roles in game development.
                Additionally, I am eager to learn more about areas like graphics programming, artificial intelligence,
                and game design principles. My education at BYUI is providing me with the skills and knowledge to pursue
                my dream, and I am excited to continue growing as a developer in this dynamic and creative field.</p>
